# Project Name - School Management System

#### Brief Description of Project -  The project was able to complete our 2nd-year, 2nd-semester project for the Information Technology Project module. A school management system has been developed to efficiently manage the operations of Boomiriya Central Collage. My contribution was teacher management. There, I made it possible to add, update, delete teacher details, and also viewcurrent teachers. Also, it was made in such a way that you can apply for leave and download the leave form as a pdf.
#### Technologies used - MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, and Node.JS

Note - The student's github account should be given in brackets e.g. (asiriRepos), this ideally should be your student id
